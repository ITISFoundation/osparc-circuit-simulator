we add here something

**Quite Universal Circuit Simulator with SPICE** ([Qucs-S]), is an *open-source* circuit simulation frontend based on [Qucs](https://qucs.github.io/) with added [SPICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE) support. It provides a Qt6 GUI and is shipped with the following **simulation kernels**:

* [Ngspice](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/): mixed-signal simulator, compatible with most industrial SPICE models, with strong performance and postprocessing tools.
* [QucsatorRF](https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucsator_rf): RF and microwave circuit simulator with models for microstrip lines and waveguides (not SPICE-compatible; limited for general-purpose use).
